        <h2>Becoming an Online Teacher</h2>
        <h5>Written By: Jo Rocca</h5>
        <h5>Published on: September 20th, 2021</h5>
        <p>Online teaching is one of the most flexible and rewarding careers. But how do you get started as a freelance online English teacher? This handy checklist will help you create an online teaching presence step-by-step.</p>

        <h3>1. Decide the subject you want to teach.</h3>
        <p>You can learn almost anything online. Which also means you can teach almost anything online! Think about what skills you would be good at communicating. You can even trial your subject by creating a YouTube how-to video, which can also help advertise your services later down the line. However, if you are really stuck and don’t know what to teach, one of the most prolific areas to teach is English. And if you are reading this article (in English), the good news is-- you already know the subject!</p>
        <p>Teaching English online is particularly fun because there are so many people who want to learn English all over the world-- and you have the opportunity to meet them! Unlike other subject areas, teaching English online doesn’t require students to have a base-knowledge of the subject, or even the language you are teaching in. Students can just jump right in and start learning!</p>

        <h3>2. Join Facebook Groups.</h3>
	      <p>Joining Facebook groups of other teachers or professionals in your subject matter is a great way to find resources, get inspiration, stay accountable and committed to your teaching journey, and get advice when you are stuck. Find at least three active Facebook groups and introduce yourself as a new online teacher and see what advice pops up from other group members!</p>

        <h3>3. Find a Platform.</h3>
        <p>The next step to becoming an online teacher is finding a platform you can teach on. There are many online platforms available, such as Class for That, Class In, and Outschool. When finding a platform, you will want to consider things such as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How does the platform advertise to students?<br>
            <p>This is important so you know how students will find you! Will you have to advertise yourself or does the platform push your lessons for you?</p>
          </li>
          <li>What is required by you as a teacher to sign up?<br>
            <p>Do you need a degree? Are only certain subjects available? Will there be an interview/demo lesson to join?</p>
          </li>
          <li>Do they offer a curriculum?<br>
            <p>Some platforms offer a curriculum to teach to students, such as Off2Class. These are great if you are new to teaching and have no clue where to start. However, you will probably find at some point that you are “stuck” in the curriculum, and may be unable to adapt it appropriately to your students or teaching style.
For this reason, I recommend finding a curriculum that is all-inclusive, but not attached to a platform. This way, you aren’t forced to teach a certain way and can adapt materials more easily. <a href="../../curriculum/index.html" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Rocca Curriculum</a> is a perfect example of this!</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4. Find a curriculum that works with your platform.</h3>
        <p>Some platforms will require you to upload your lessons beforehand, while others only need a brief description or advertisement for what you will be teaching. You will also need to keep in mind how the lessons are taught. If students are taught through Zoom screen-sharing, for example, interactive features might not be available for them to use.
            <a href="../../curriculum/index.html" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Rocca Curriculum</a> works great on all platforms, as the PDF downloads can be used for “lesson previews”. The games are also compatible with most platforms, as they offer instructions and adaptations for when students are unable to interact with the content themselves, while still being engaging!</p>

        <h3>5. Decide on your rate.</h3>
        <p>Online teaching can be very prolific, if done correctly. However, many teachers undercharge for their services. When deciding your rate, take into account the fact that you are running a business! You are putting in your own time and energy to create lessons, advertise your classes, not to mention the actual teaching! You will also be purchasing your own materials, such as props, backgrounds, curriculum, and more. Finally, since on most platforms you are either a subcontractor or freelancer, you will need to provide your own employee benefits such as days off, vacation time, and health insurance. All of this factored together means you need to charge more.</p>
        <p>Online English classes are typically around 30 minutes long and go for a rate of $25-$50/lesson. Depending on your experience and what you are offering, you may want to charge more than this. There will be a student or parent who is looking for high-quality teachers and higher prices suggest higher quality! So don’t be afraid to set your prices a bit higher.</p>

        <h3>6. Create a teacher profile.</h3>
        <p>On your chosen platform, or on your own website if the platform does not have profiles, create a teacher profile. Be sure to include as much information as possible, including past education, certifications, and previous experiences with the subject matter or with teaching. Photos also go a very long way!</p>
        <p>If you need your own website to advertise your services, check out <a href="../../../index.html" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Rocca Web</a>.</p>

        <h3>7. Upload lesson samples.</h3>
        <p>As stated previously, some platforms will require you to upload entire lessons, while others may just require a blurb to advertise. On your platform, create lessons that you want to teach and again, include as much information as possible to attract students. With <a href="../../curriculum/index.html" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Rocca Curriculum</a>, we provide you with full PDFs of the lesson content so you can upload your lessons efficiently.</p>

        <h3>8. Create a schedule.</h3>
        <p>Most platforms will allow you to set your own schedule for teaching through opening slots on a calendar app. Decide what hours you would like to work each week, and open those slots! Be consistent each week so that you can attract students back and get regular students!</p>

        <p>And there you have it! You are all set up to start online teaching! Online teaching is easy to get into and, if done correctly, profitable and rewarding.</p>
