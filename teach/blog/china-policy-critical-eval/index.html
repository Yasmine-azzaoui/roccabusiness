        <h2>Explainer: China's Education Policies</h2>
        <h5>Written By: Jo Rocca</h5>
        <h5>Published on: September 20th, 2021</h5>
        <p>In July 2021, China implemented a radical new education policy. The policy, known as the “Dual Alleviation Policy”, was implemented to address such issues as the high cost of having children and intense academic pressure on students (for more information, read this article explaining the policy changes). In this article, I look at the impacts of this new education policy and its effectiveness at addressing the target problems.</p>
        <img class="left-img" src="../../img/forbidden-city.jpg" alt="Forbidden City"/>

        <h3>Impacts of the Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>The Dual Alleviation Policy is deeply rooted in the cultural and historical context of China, and marks a new era in the country’s development, focusing on higher social problems, rather than solely on poverty and hunger (Zhao 2021). However, the impacts of the Dual Alleviation Policy seem, thus far, to be more harmful, as it does not sufficiently address the root causes of the problems it is targeting.</p>
        <p>First, increasing the quality of public education is a large investment. For example, the goal of attracting high-quality teachers to the public sector would mean a doubling of the current minimum teacher’s salary (The Global Times 2021). Therefore, many teachers have chosen, instead, to leave the education sector altogether. Yet the Dual Alleviation Policy has limited sources of investment by not allowing foreign capital to fund education. Additionally, the ban on foreign teachers and curriculum limits the resource and talent pools from which the education system can draw, thus limiting the quality of public education further.</p>
        <p>Second, the economic inequalities that the policy claims to address are actually further exacerbated by the changes. As MingXia*, a Chinese citizen and policy expert, stated, without educational groups, the Chinese government has no power to regulate online teachers located abroad. These teachers, then, have shifted towards freelancing, which has driven up their prices due to operation costs. Additionally, because these freelance tutors are not sanctioned by the government, families need connections in order to find them. This means that only families with a certain degree of wealth and power, then, can access online tutoring (Zhao 2021). Even if China were to crack-down on online freelance tutors, many parents would still seek to extend their children’s academic opportunities through “overseas courses, camps and programmes for Chinese students” (Venture Education 2021). This would ultimately lead to China needing to import high-quality education and educators, rather than an increased quality in public education.</p>

        <h3>The Real Problem</h3>
        <img class="right-img" src="../../img/workspace-coffee.jpg" alt="studying"/>
        <p>Ultimately, the Dual Alleviation Policy falls short because it fails to address the root of China’s education problem-- the GaoKao. The GaoKao is a standardized test required to access higher education and is used by almost all universities in China as a requirement for admission. Millions of students across China take this test every year. In 2013, for example, about "9.4 million graduating seniors across China" took this test (Schroch 2014). The test is high-stakes and failure can result in students being barred from higher education, which is why many parents opt for private tutoring in the first place (Zhao 2021). Its structure, however, is designed to select government officers, and favors “those from professional families, from urban developed areas and those who have better secondary schools" (Liu 2013).</p>
        <p>The academic pressures that students experience, therefore, do not come from private tutoring itself, but from the GaoKao. And since the cut-off score is determined by the Ministry of Education, and not by universities themselves, “it deprives Chinese universities from becoming independent and autonomous entities (You & Hu 2013) and might also make several Chinese universities go down in the reports of world-class university rankings.” (Muthanna and Sang 2015). The university admission in China is more competitive, but the resulting education is less prestigious, meaning wealthy families may again choose to send their children to universities abroad, while families of average or low income are left to fight for their children to receive even a basic university education.</p>
        <p>Additionally, since the test is standardized, it is memory-based and does not test critical thinking skills or vocational talent. This creates a two-fold problem that limits the number of high-quality educators in China. The first part is that public school teachers are limited in curriculum by “teaching the test”. Additionally, because teaching is a vocation that involves more creative and critical thinking skills, the GaoKao may bar talented individuals from pursuing teaching as a career to begin with.</p>
        <img class="left-img" src="../../img/man-silouette.jpg" alt="stressed student"/>
        <p>It should be noted, however, that the GaoKao is an integral part of China’s education system. The GaoKao embodies Confucian beliefs of social mobility through education, as well as the Chinese tradition of fostering competition, both of which have been firmly rooted in Chinese culture for thousands of years (Zhao 2021). Like the Dual Alleviation Policy, the GaoKao was “a key mechanism of structuring higher education opportunities, and academic performance in the Gaokao, instead of political affiliation, became the decisive factor in access to higher education” (Liu 2013). Bribes and nepotism are still commonplace in other sectors of China and removing the GaoKao would make the education sector vulnerable to corruption. It was created to address these issues and the inequalities in access to education, and most Chinese citizens would agree that it does this, to an extent. However, like the Dual Alleviation Policy, it failed to address the root cause-- corruption-- and instead created culture of high-stakes, high-pressure education. And in spite of this, the grading system still favors certain groups such as ethnic minorities, military personnel, and the disabled, who may receive extra points or may even be able to gain university admission without taking the exam at all (as cited in Hannum, An, & Cherng 2011).</p>
        <p>The GaoKao has been the subject of much academic research, most of which agrees that the test needs restructuring. The GaoKao is commonly compared to the ACT and SAT tests in the United States, which are also used for university entrance. However, the GaoKao is more high-stakes, as “only few Chinese universities have autonomy in determining their admission standards and conduct independent student recruitment.” (Zhu and MacDonald 2014).  This stems from the government’s complete control over higher education in China. Pressures from the GaoKao have also been shown to cause a profound number of life-long psychological problems and even suicides of young adults in China (He, 2000; Yu & Suen, 2005).</p>

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>The Dual Alleviation Policy is meant to address specific problems in the education sector in China. However, it misses the mark by not addressing the root cause of these problems-- the GaoKao. This policy, then, can be viewed as a band-aid solution. While it will lead to short-term change and perhaps even improvement, long-term it is more likely to exacerbate the very issues it is trying to address.</p>
