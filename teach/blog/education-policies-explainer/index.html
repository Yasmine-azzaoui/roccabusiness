        <h2>Explainer: China's Education Policies</h2>
        <h5>Written By: Jo Rocca</h5>
        <h5>Published on: September 20th, 2021</h5>
        <p class="intro">In July 2021, China implemented a radical new education policy. Although the policy, known as the “Dual Alleviation” policy, was implemented suddenly, discussions of possible changes had been on-going since three years earlier (Venture Education 2021). However, the sudden implementation left many in the education sector with questions as to what these changes mean moving forward. In this article, I look at the recent policy changes and why they have occured.</p>
        <img class="left-img" src="../../img/beijing-architecture.jpg" alt="Beijing"/>
        <h3>An Explanation of Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>First, let’s take a look at what has changed. Many of the changes revolve around a shift in how education is funded. This includes banning foreign investment in education and regulating the use of public funds. Without getting too technical, these changes essentially mark a shift away from what has been termed the “hyper-capitalization” of education in China in favor of public schools (The Global Times 2021).</p>
        <p>Another key change is geared towards limiting hours students spend studying. This is done two ways. First, tutoring before school-age (under the age of 6), is prohibited. Second, tutoring is not allowed on public holidays or vacation days. According to a former HR education group representative, who wishes to remain anonymous, this means that “[n]ow there are two ways to teach English in China: 1. Find your clients by yourself, do not teach children through educational group or company (which means freelance teaching business is safe now). Or 2. Teach adults English (both working in an education group or being freelance are ok.”</p>
        <p>However, the third major change created by the policy is a ban on both foreign curriculum and foreign teachers. This is because the policy change is meant to target education groups and foreign teachers. However, as stated previously, freelance teaching is still permitted. As Chinese citizen and policy expert, Mingxia*  states, “There is a ban for all foreign teachers located outside of China. But, firstly, freelance teaching business is very difficult to supervise. Secondly, so far, if parents are caught privately hiring a foreign teacher, there is no actual penalty or punishment.” The policy, at the time of writing, does not punish parents or families seeking outside tutoring for their children.</p>


        <h3>Reasoning Behind the Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>Next, let’s take a look at each of these policy changes in turn, and the logic behind them. First, Chinese policy makers believe the shift towards public education is more in-line with Chinese socialist values, in which education is a public good (Sixth Tone 2021). Additionally, private online education has been of growing concern to the Chinese government, which already heavily regulates citizen’s access to information via the internet.</p>
        <p>As one article states, “The government’s desire to assert control over the economy and one of its most valuable resources lies at the heart of recent regulatory clampdowns on online industries. Companies that operate as internet platforms have come increasingly under scrutiny because of the reams of data they collect, stirring government concern over issues of privacy and security,” (Chan, et al. 2021).</p>
        <img class="right-img" src="../../img/lightbulb.jpg" alt="lightbulb"/>
        <p>Additionally, the government hopes that by shutting down the private sector, they can attract highly qualified teachers back to the public sector to increase the quality of public education. In terms of online platforms, the State Council stated its desire to “improve the quality of state-run online education services and make them free of charge” (cf. ibid). Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the education think tank 21st Century Education Research Institute, says that “If the quality of public education continues to improve, there will be a drop in the demand for private education.” (Sixth Tone 2021).</p>
        <p>Other reasons given for the Dual Alleviation Policy are geared towards families, such as increasing the birth-rate and addressing economic inequalities. Mingxia explains, “The census shows a low [birth] rate. At the same time, the government announces the relaxation of its one-child policy. However, young people do not buy it. They complain about the cost of raising extra children…”.  A major cost for raising children in China is tuition fees for private education, which can range between 12,000-300,000 yuan per year ($2,440-$46,395.10 USD) (Zhao 2021). Eliminating this cost can go a long way towards allowing parents to afford having more children. Mingxia continues by saying “basically, this policy is telling Chinese parents ‘[Y]ou don’t need [to] put too much money on your first child. You can save the money to have your second or third [child].” The heavy investment in education is also viewed as contributing to economic inequality, as not every family can afford such hefty fees, even with only one child.</p>
        <p>The second policy change involves limiting hours students spend in tutoring, in order to encourage children to grow in autonomy, creativity, and critical thinking. For this reason, only certain academic areas are subject to this change, with “Culture, Arts, and Sciences” excluded (Venture Education 2021). The final change, banning foreign curriculum and foreign teachers, is meant to streamline content to be in line with national curriculum standards, in order to further close the education inequality gap.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>While many teachers have been shocked and confused by the changes in China’s education policy, the changes are not altogether surprising when taking into account the historical and cultural context of China itself. However, the effectiveness of these policies remains to be seen. For a critical evaluation of these policies, read this article.</p>
