        <h2>Get in the Business</h2>
        <h5>Written By: Jo Rocca</h5>
        <h5>Published on: September 20th, 2021</h5>
        <p>One of the biggest things you can do for yourself when you begin freelance teaching is to legitimize your business. Think of yourself as a business, and run yourself as such. This means having a professional appearance, legal legitimacy, and streamlined processes. In this article, we will walk you through the basics you will need to run your teaching business.</p>

        <h3>1. Branding Your Business</h3>
        <img class="left-img" src="../../img/online-collab.jpg"/>
        <p>The first thing you will need to do as a business owner is the most obvious-- create a business name! This can be something simple, like “Teacher Jane” or it can be something more creative, like “English with Ellen”. It can have alliteration or not, but the main thing is that it’s short, describes what you are doing, and memorable. This step is important, as it will help you in the next steps.</p>
        <p>You can also go further with branding by creating a logo, business cards, Facebook page, website, and more, but at the bare minimum you will need a name that you can use consistently across platforms and advertisements. You can make these yourself on <a href="https://www.canva.com/q/pro/?utm_source=google_sem&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=REV_AU_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Core_EM&utm_term=REV_AU_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Canva_EM&utm_content=2160_control&gclid=Cj0KCQjwv5uKBhD6ARIsAGv9a-xnbcin083DeU2nX7_AHJraZS34rmRm6pWHd7js4OSBH_URjof-39QaAjuVEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Canva</a>, or you can <a href="../../../index.html" target="_blank" class="callout-link">hire a professional.</a></p>

        <h3>2. Registering Your Business</h3>
        <p>Next, you will need to check if you should register your business. If you are considered an employee of a platform, you probably don’t need to register. But, if you are operating on multiple platforms or are considered a subcontractor, it may be useful to register yourself as a business in your own right. If you are based in the US, you can also get an EIN for free, which gives you a unique ID number for your business that you can use on paperwork instead of your Social Security Number. This can come in handy if you choose to do something like open a dedicated business bank account. Additionally, registering your business covers you legally and gives you more rights than an employee, such as ability to negotiate terms and contracts. However, it does also mean that you will need to pay quarterly taxes. For more information on this, jump to the <a href="#money-matters" class="callout-link">“Money Matters”</a> section.</p>

        <h3>3. Create a Contract</h3>
        <img class="right-img" src="../../img/guy-on-phone.jpg"/>
        <p>If your platform does not have a contract with you or your students, you will need to create one. You can do this easily, as well as collect signatures, through apps such as <a href="https://app.hellosign.com/prep-and-send/344ed9968dbfe47525c7bde9eb1ebc1ef139163e/documents" target="_blank" class="callout-link">HelloSign</a>. Your contract can include things such as student cancellation policies, pay rates, payment methods, timeframes, and student/parent expectations to protect yourself. It also should aspects that protect your students, such as guarantees of services, teacher cancellation policies, and refund policies. This is again important for protecting all parties involved, and also makes parents feel more invested and committed to the education services you are providing. You can also use these contracts to create class packages, allowing students to buy multiple classes in advance.</p>
        <p>For more information on packages, or for a template contract, I highly recommend <a href="https://thevirtualsavvy.samcart.com/referral/UdMrok5Y/u7DZDVbCiVlnkhxY" target="_blank" class="callout-link">“The Virtual Savvy”</a>. The Virtual Savvy is geared towards virtual assistant services, but their contract is easily amenable to teaching. They also are quick to help your answer questions should you need assistance adapting the contract to your specific wants and needs.</p>

        <h3>4. Streamline Processes</h3>
        <p>Like any job, as an online teacher you need a routine, particularly for regular occurrences such as opening time slots, communicating with parents, and booking students. Your platform may, again, take care of this, but if you are on multiple platforms, you may also want to come up with your own system to make sure you aren’t missing anything. Decide how often you will communicate with students about their progress. Will it be after each class, after assessments, monthly, or some combination of these? Follow up and progress reports are expected as a teacher, so make sure you know how you will handle these.</p>
        <p>Another important process to streamline is accepting payment. This may, again, be handled through your platform. However, if it isn’t, there are plenty of options, which will be covered in the next section.</p>

        <h3 id="money-matters">5. Money Matters</h3>
        <img class="left-img" src="../../img/business-book.jpg"/>
        <p>Of course as a freelance teacher, you want to be making money! However, before you start dreaming about buying that dream vacation, there are a few money matters we need to cover.</p>
        <p>First, remember financial guru Dave Ramsey’s golden rule about paychecks-- pay yourself first. Make sure you are giving yourself a consistent hourly rate that covers all of your personal expenses, like rent and food. After all, you need to make a living! Especially since, as an online teacher, you are not given employee benefits such as paid leave or health insurance. So make sure you are taken care of before you put money towards anything else. Next, make a budget for your business expenses. This includes props you buy, curriculum you subscribe to, and even educating yourself if you are becoming a certified teacher or getting TEFL certification. <a href="https://thevirtualsavvy.samcart.com/referral/UdMrok5Y/u7DZDVbCiVlnkhxY" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Virtual Savvy</a> also has a template you can use for this. It is important to keep track of these because all of these expenses are tax deductible. Speaking of which…</p>
        <p>Let’s talk taxes! Look carefully at your contract with your chosen platform. Do they take state and federal taxes out of your paycheck? The answer is probably no. This means that you will have to pay your own taxes (and also it is more likely that you will have to register as a business). Business taxes are paid quarterly and can take up to 25% of your income. For more information about this, I again recommend <a href="https://thevirtualsavvy.samcart.com/referral/UdMrok5Y/u7DZDVbCiVlnkhxY" target="_blank" class="callout-link"> Virtual Savvy</a>. They have an entire unit dedicated to finances, including budgeting, taxes, and our final money topic-- invoicing.</p>
        <p>In most cases, your students will pay for your classes upfront. However, creating a professional invoice or receipt of purchase makes you seem like a more serious, legitimate teaching business. It also helps parents or students when it’s time for them to do their taxes. My favorite method of invoicing is using <a href="https://next.waveapps.com/697bd5f6-aaa5-43a0-83be-3a1f52d5f59c/invoices/add" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Wave Payments</a>, which creates digital invoices and allows for payments through the platform for a small percentage. You can also simply send a receipt of payment generated by your bank or a dedicated payment platform. Common payment platforms for online teachers include <a href="https://wise.com/au/" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Wise</a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/au/business" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Paypal Business Accounts</a>, and <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" class="callout-link">Stripe</a>. Each of these accepts international payments, including Alipay (the preferred payment method in China), although there may be a percentage taken out for international exchanges. Explore each of these options and decide which one suits your new teaching business best.</p>

        <p>These are the bare minimum requirements for freelance teaching. Some of them may be covered by your chosen platform, but make sure to check to save yourself stress and headaches in the future! Good luck and happy teaching!</p>
